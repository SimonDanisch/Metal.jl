# Fused scaled-dot-product attention on `tensor_ops::matmul2d`.
#
# The three-pass form — scores, softmax, apply — has to MATERIALISE the `Lq x Lk` score
# matrix, and at SAM 2.1's 4096-token global block that is 256 MiB written by the first
# pass, read and rewritten by the second and read again by the third. A gigabyte of traffic
# for 38.7 GFLOP of arithmetic, which is why all three passes sit within a factor of two of
# this machine's memory bandwidth and nowhere near its compute.
#
# Fused, the score tile never leaves threadgroup memory: one threadgroup owns `BQ` queries
# of one (head, batch), walks the keys in tiles of `BK`, and keeps a running max, a running
# sum and an `E x BQ` Float32 output accumulator — the standard online-softmax recurrence.
# Both products are `matmul2d`, and the second one reads its right operand out of
# THREADGROUP memory, which the run helpers support per operand.
#
# Measured on an M5, fp16, E = 72, against the three declared passes it replaces (each
# timed inside the same recorded plan):
#
#   Lq = Lk = 4096, 8 heads     22.16 -> 12.99 ms   1.71x
#   Lq = Lk =  256, 128 windows  1.44 ->  1.02 ms   1.41x
#
# `BQ = 16, BK = 128` with four simdgroups is the best of 40 tilings tried, on BOTH shapes,
# so the tiling is not a per-shape choice here. Bigger `BQ` loses to its accumulator's
# threadgroup footprint (occupancy) and smaller `BK` to the score product's aspect ratio.
